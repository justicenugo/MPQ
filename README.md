# MPQ
A priority queue is a data structure where each element has a priority associated with it.
A MPQ is a type of priority queue that gives priority to the minimum value element.

This project was implemented using three data structures: vector, linked list, and binary heap. Afterwards, the time complexity was analyzed for the different MPQs.
